"""Utility functions module for common operations.

This module contains reusable utility functions that can be used across the application.
It provides helper methods, convenience functions, and shared functionality to promote
code reuse and maintainability.

Typical usage example:

    from repo_scaffold.utils import validate_input, format_output

    cleaned_data = validate_input(raw_data)
    result = format_output(cleaned_data)

Note:
    All utility functions should be stateless and follow single responsibility principle.
    New utility functions should be well documented with type hints and docstrings.
